# PMT-PDF-Loader
A chrome extension to load PMT PDFs when they get stuck 

### Installation
1. Go to [chrome extensions](chrome://extensions/ "Chrome Extensions")
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Load Packed (top left)
4. Select source directory

### Usage
1. Load PMT page
2. Open extension and click "LOAD PDF"

### Sidenote
This extension was purely made because I was annoyed at how slow PMT was most of the time. I could defintely improve this by always automatically redirecting any PMT pdf page straight to the raw pdf. However I'm not really bothered by clicking a button, so perhaps after my A Levels I'll actually figure out how to do that and publish the extension.
